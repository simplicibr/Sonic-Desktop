The project works fine! Well, at least on my machine. I dont know why but for some reason it doesnt work on AMD GPU's, I am trying to fix this.

The problem: In some GPU's the background of the window does not become transparent so you can't see anything other than sonic running in a blue background, it seems to work well on NVIDIA's GPU's.
